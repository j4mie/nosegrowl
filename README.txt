on 2011-07-02 by Jamie Matthews. I have not made any changes to
the code. It's here purely so that it can be installed with Pip
without needing to have Mercurial installed. I won't be accepting
pull requests, issues etc here.

To install with Pip:

pip install -e git+git://github.com/j4mie/nosegrowl.git#egg=nose-growl
